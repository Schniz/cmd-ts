/**
 * An effect to exit the program with a message
 *
 * **Why this is an effect?**
 *
 * Using `process.exit` in a program is both a problem:
 * * in tests, because it needs to be mocked somehow
 * * in browser usage, because it does not have `process` at all
 *
 * Also, using `console.log` is something we'd rather avoid and return strings, and if returning strings
 * would be harmful for performance we might ask for a stream to write to:
 * Printing to stdout and stderr means that we don't control the values and it ties us to only use `cmd-ts`
 * with a command line, and again, to mock `stdout` and `stderr` it if we want to test it.
